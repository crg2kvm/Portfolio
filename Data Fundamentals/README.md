### Linear Classification

This notebook focuses on linear classification techniques, specifically the Perceptron algorithm and logistic regression. It includes the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm, demonstrating its updating rules and convergence criteria, followed by a comparison with logistic regression. The notebook further explores logistic regression using a real-world dataset, involving data preprocessing with OneHotEncoder and examining the effects of
