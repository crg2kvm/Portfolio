### Linear Classification

This notebook focuses on linear classification techniques, specifically the Perceptron algorithm and logistic regression. It includes the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm, demonstrating its updating rules and convergence criteria, followed by a comparison with logistic regression. The notebook further explores logistic regression using a real-world dataset, involving data preprocessing with OneHotEncoder and examining the effects of

### Naive Bayes

This notebook includes exercises on basic probability, conditional probability, joint probability, and Bayes' Theorem. The notebook also includes a data visualization task, where a dataset is loaded containing hippocampus volumes of individuals, creating scatter plots to observe correlations between left and right hippocampus volumes, differentiated by dementia status. A Naive Bayes classifier is used to leverage these probabilities to classify dementia status based on hippocampus volume data.
