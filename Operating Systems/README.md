# Operating Systems Projects
## Overview
This directory contains various projects related to Operating Systems, demonstrating different aspects of OS functionalities and concepts.

## Projects
### Custom Built Shell:

The Custom Built Shell Command Line project implements a simple yet functional command-line shell that mimics basic Unix shell functionalities. It supports command execution, input/output redirection, pipelining, and background process execution. The project includes the main shell driver, command parser, and command executor, demonstrating key concepts such as command parsing, process creation, and inter-process communication. This project provides a practical example of how an operating system shell operates at a fundamental level.
### Process Scheduler:

Implements different process scheduling algorithms such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin (RR).
Illustrates how operating systems manage CPU time allocation among processes.
### Memory Manager:

Simulates memory allocation and management techniques, including paging and segmentation.
Shows how operating systems handle memory distribution and protection.
### Shell Implementation:

Develops a simple command-line shell that can execute basic commands and handle input/output redirection.
Demonstrates command parsing, process creation, and inter-process communication.
### Synchronization Mechanisms:

Implements synchronization primitives such as semaphores, mutexes, and condition variables.
Explores solutions to common concurrency problems like the Producer-Consumer and Readers-Writers problems.
